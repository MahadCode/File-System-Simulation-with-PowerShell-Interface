# File-System-Simulation-with-PowerShell-Interface
This project implements a simulation of a file system in C++ using a binary file as a virtual disk and provides a command-line interface through PowerShell. It mimics the behavior of a basic file system, offering functionalities for managing files and directories, reading and writing data, and simulating disk operations.
